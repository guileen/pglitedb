# Project Context Navigation

★ Core Goal: Maintain efficient context management for AI agents working with PGLiteDB, focusing on maintainability and technical debt reduction

This file serves as the central index for project context. All AI agents should reference this file first, then proceed to the relevant aspect-specific context files.

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference
⚠️ Common Issues and Solutions:
1. **ORDER BY Not Preserved**: Check `protocol/sql/optimizer.go` - ensure `applyRewriteRules` properly copies all plan fields including OrderBy
2. **Catalog Not Initialized**: Verify `NewPlannerWithCatalog` and `SetCatalog` methods in `protocol/sql/planner.go`
3. **Parse Failures**: Check if using correct parser (`PGParser` vs custom parser) in `protocol/sql/parser.go`

## Development Workflow Guidance
1. **Bug Fixing Path**:
   - Start with failing test in `protocol/sql/integration_test.go`
   - Trace through `planner.go` → `optimizer.go` → `executor.go`
   - Check plan preservation in optimization steps

2. **Feature Implementation Path**:
   - Define schema in `catalog/` 
   - Implement parsing in `parser.go`
   - Add planning logic in `planner.go`
   - Optimize in `optimizer.go`
   - Execute in `executor.go`
