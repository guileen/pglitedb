# Test Execution Log

## Commands Executed

```

## Issues Identified

### 1. Client Test Failures
The client tests are failing with file system errors:
```
2025/11/30 09:46:01 000006.log:
rename /var/folders/w6/xvny1q5j3_s4gyr66qqfg5l40000gn/T/pglitedb-client-test-2993200666/test-db/000002.log /var/folders/w6/xvny1q5j3_s4gyr66qqfg5l40000gn/T/pglitedb-client-test-2993200666/test-db/000006.log: no such file or directory
```

### 2. Engine Test Timeout Issues
Several engine tests are timing out, particularly:
- `TestStorageEngine_BoundaryCases`
- `TestSnapshotTransaction_DeleteRows`

### 3. SQL Protocol Test Failures
Several SQL protocol tests are failing:

#### TestIntegration_ComplexScenarios/TransactionWithSQL
Expected: 3, Actual: 10
This suggests an issue with LIMIT clause parsing or execution.

#### TestPlannerCacheEviction
Cache size expectations not met, indicating potential issues with cache eviction logic.

#### TestPlannerCacheStatistics
Hit rate calculation discrepancy, suggesting issues with cache statistics tracking.

## Areas Recently Fixed

Based on git history, the following areas were recently addressed:
1. Compilation error fix in `memcomparable_helpers.go` (missing sync import)
2. SQL parser enhancements with smart hybrid decision logic
3. Concurrent access test utilities
